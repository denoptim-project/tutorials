# Tutorial 1.0: Molecular Fragments
The fundamental concept in DENOPTIM's world is that chemical objects, such as molecules and materials, are made of building blocks that can be attached to form a **Graph**-like structure. Building blocks are, therefore, called **Vertices** or **Nodes** of the graph that defines a chemical object. The most intuitive type of building block or vertex is a **molecular fragment**. Molecular fragments can contain one or more atoms, bonds, and, as well as any other vertex, are decorated with **attachment points**. The latter collect the information defining how a fragment can be used to build molecules by attaching fragments to each other.

## Visualize Molecular Fragments

1. Open [DENOPTIM's GUI](../gui.md) and choose `File` -> `Open` then navigate to open the file `exercise_1.0/fragments-1.sdf` from the unzipped [downloaded dataset](header-dataset). The same file can be opened directly in the command line by issuing the following command from within the folder created when unzipping the downloaded dataset:
	```
	denoptim exercise_1.0/fragments-1.sdf
	```
	The graphical interface will open a window and display the fragments contained in the file.

	![figures/fragment_view.png](figures/fragment_view.png)

	**Figure 1**: The graphical representation of a molecular fragment. The red arrow indicates the spinner used to navigate the list of fragments.

2. Use the mouse to rotate the three-dimensional molecular representation of the fragment (click and drag).

	Molecular fragments can have any number of atoms and any number of attachment points (the yellow arrow in the three-dimensional representation), each of which defined the possibility to bind another building block. The attachment point is decorated by a string, i.e., the so-called **Attachment Point Class** (**APClass**), that is used to control how attachment points can be used to connect fragments. For clarity, the APClass is declared in the table below the three-dimensional representation of the fragment.

3. Use the spinner in the top-right part of the window (see in red arrow figure above) to navigate to the next fragments and backwards. Navigate to the third fragment.

	Fragments can also contain *pseudoatoms*/*dummy* atoms, as shown in the third fragment: a [cycplopentadienyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclopentadienyl) fragment that offers the possibility to host a substituent different from H on one of the carbon atoms. Note the *dummy* atom placed at the centroid of the ring: it is used to hold the attachment point that represents the capability to use such fragment to bind a meta in hapto-5 mode (&eta;<sup>5</sup>).

4. Click on the `Node View` button to show what each fragment represents in terms of graph building blocks.

	Each **molecular fragment** represents a single **vertex** that can be used as a building block for a graph. The chemical content, i.e., the number and identity of the atoms and bonds, is not relevant when perceiving molecular fragments as graph building blocks. Instead, what defines the characteristics of the vertex is the set of attachment points, each with its own APClass.

## Make Fragments in the GUI
1. We will now make new molecular fragments that we could use as building blocks. To exploit the existing chemical knowledge we will make such molecular fragments by *fragmenting* (a.k.a chopping up) a known compound. Click on `File` -> `New` -> `New Molecular Fragments` to open a new vertex inspector tab. Then click on the dedicated button to *Import a structure from* `File` (see red arrow in the figure below).

	![figures/fragment_view_importFromFile.png](figures/fragment_view_importFromFile.png)

	**Figure 3**: Buttons used to import a structure from file (red arrow) and launch the fragmentation (green arrow).

2. Once the molecule is displayed, you can click on `Chop Structure` (see green arrow in the figure above) to start the automated generation of fragments. This will open a new window that offers the possibility to control the **cutting rule**, i.e., the rules defining how the structure should be cut (see below). Click on `Start fragmentation` to accept the defaults.

3. The result will be a set of 4 new fragments obtained by cutting the bonds marked by a star in the following figure. Once we confirm to import all of them, these fragments will be loaded in the current vertex inspector tab.

	![figures/aspirin_cuts.png](figures/aspirin_cuts.png)

	**Figure 4**: Bonds identified by the default cutting rules and cut Buttons used to import a structure from file (red arrow) and launch the fragmentation (green arrow).

	The set of fragments and the APClass on the attachment points of the generated fragments are the result of the **cutting rules**. A single cutting rule is a substructure pattern that defines which bonds are broken by a specific cutting rule and what is the APClass of the resulting attachment points. Further details are available in the [dedicated documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/denoptim-project/DENOPTIM/blob/master/doc/user_manual.html#Toc2222_2) and publication ([*J. Chem. Inf. Model.* **2014**, 54, 7, 1919â€“1931](https://doi.org/10.1021/ci5003153)). In brief, each cutting rule is expressed as a [SMARTS](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html) resulting by the combination of the components dedicated to the bond it self and the atoms connected by such bond. The cutting rule can be inspected in the dialog shown when clicking on the `Chop Structure` button.

4. Attachment points can also be generated manually. Select one or more terminal atoms by clicking on them, and click on the `Atom to AP` button (see red arrow in the figure) to transform one or more atom in attachment points. A dialog will allow to specify the APClass of the resulting attachment points.

## Use the Fragmenter
Fragmentation of many structures is more efficiently performed by running DENOPTIM's Fragmenter from the command line. Moreover, the Fragmenter offers additional possibilities:
* apply filtering criteria to the structures to be fragmented,
* remove duplicate fragments,
* apply filtering criteria on generated fragments,
* identify the most representative conformations of a molecular fragment.

This tutorial will take structures from the [Crystallography Open Database](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/result.php) and chop them to generate and organise fragment automatically. In general, the source of the geometries can be any crystallography database, or any database of computed structures.
In this specific example, out goal is to collect fragments of chelated Ru-alkilydene complexes, which might be used to design Ru catalyst for [olefin metathesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olefin_metathesis).

1. Collect the structures from which to generate fragments. For this exercise the structures are already collected in file `exercise_1.0/structures_from_COD.cif` from the [downloaded dataset](header-dataset).

	The structures used here can be obtained from the [Crystallography Open Database](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/index.php):  [4064102](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/4064102.html), [4064965](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/4064965.html), [4064964](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/4064964.html), [4064967](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/4064967.html), [4068123](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/4068123.html), [4068964](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/4068964.html), [4068965](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/4068965.html), [4068966](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/4068966.html), [4075179](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/4075179.html), [4075180](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/4075180.html), [4110988](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/4110988.html), [1504708](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/1504708.html), [1504709](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/1504709.html), and [4064690](http://www.crystallography.net/cod/4064690.html).

2. The settings of the Framenter are collected in an input file prepared according to the [user manual](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/denoptim-project/DENOPTIM/blob/master/doc/user_manual.html#Toc2222_1). An example of such file is available as `exercise_1.0/fragmentation.params`. The content is the following:
	```text
	FRG-StructuresFile=structures_from_COD.cif
	FRG-CuttingRulesFile=cutting_rules
	FRG-RetainSMARTS=[Ru]
	FRG-RejectSMARTS=[#6]~[Ru]~[#6]
	FRG-IsomorphicSampleSize=20
	FRG-ClusterizeAndCollect=centroids
	```
	In this specific case, we ask the Fragmenter to chop the structures found in file `structures_from_COD.cif` using the cutting rules available in file `cutting_rules`. In addition, we ask to keep only fragments that contains at least one ruthenium atom (line 3 in the example above) while not containing any chain of atoms matching the carbon-(any bond)-ruthenium-(any bond)-carbon patterns (line 4 in the example above). These constrains reflect the desire to collect only Ru-containing fragments that do not contain partially fragmented systems, which would contain more than one organometallic bond to Ru.
	Line 5 and 6 control the identification of the most representative fragments. Namely, fragments are to be collected in samples of isomorphic fragments (i.e., fragments with the same graph structure of atoms and attachment points, but not necessarily the same geometry. Effectively, isomorphic fragments have the same constitution of atoms and attachment points, but potentially different stereochemistry) counting up to 20 fragments (line 5). For each such sample of isomorphic fragments, the Fragmenter will then run a clustering analysis based on the RMSD of atomic positions upon frozen-geometry superposition to discriminate isomorphic fragments with different geometry and will return the centroid of each such cluster as the most representative fragment of the cluster (line 6).

3. Run the fragmentation from within the `exercise_1.0` folder using this command:
	```
	denoptim -r FRG fragmentation.params
	```

4. A new folder will be created with name <code>FRG<i>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</i></code> where <code><i>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</i></code> is the time stamp. Log files tracking the workings of the process, and files collecting intermediate data are contained in this folder. In particular, the final collection of the most representative fragments, i.e., the centroid of each cluster of isomorphic fragments, is saved in file `FRGYYYYMMDDHHMMSS/Fragments.sdf`. It is convenient to open such file in the graphical user interface to inspect the results (**NB:** replace </i>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</i> with the appropriate values):
	```
	denoptim FRGYYYYMMDDHHMMS/Fragments.sdf
	```

	Note that the fragment corresponding to the chelating *ortho*-alkoxybenzylidene (Figure 6) is the centroid of a cluster collecting a handful of isomorphic and geometrically similar fragments. This information can be found in the `ConformerExtractorTask-\*_IsomorphicFamily_\*.log` files. The centroid is calculated averaging all atomic positions, thus the noise due to small distortions in the geometries is attenuated.

	**Figure 6**: Fragment obtained as the cluster centroid for *ortho*-alkoxybenzylidene-chelated ruthenium centers. The atom in magenta is a dummy atom added by DENOPTIM to facilitate the manipulation of linearities around the metal center.

	Moreover, note that the isomorphic but geometrically diverse fragments in Figure 7 are collected separately as they belong to two different geometry clusters of the same sample of isomorphic fragments.

	![figures/fragment_view_cit-trans.png](figures/fragment_view_cit-trans.png)

	**Figure 7**: isomorphic but geometrycally different fragments, i.e., these fragments have the same constitution but different configuration at the Ru center: *trans* for the fragment on the left, *cis* for that on the right. The atom in magenta is a dummy atom added by DENOPTIM to facilitate the manipulation of linearities around the metal center.
