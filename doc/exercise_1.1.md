# Tutorial 1.1: Graph Representation
The fundamental concept in DENOPTIM's world is that chemical objects, such as molecules and materials, are made of building blocks that can be attached to form a **Graph**-like structure. Building blocks are, therefore, called **Vertices** or **Nodes** of the graph that defines a chemical object. The most intuitive type of building block or vertex is a **molecular fragment**. Molecular fragments can contain one or more atoms, bonds, and, as well as any other vertex, are decorated with **attachment points**. The latter collect the information defining how a fragment can be used to build molecules by attaching fragments to each other.

## Visualize a DENOPTIM Graph

1. Open [DENOPTIM's GUI](header-gui) and choose `File` -> `Open` then navigate to open the file `exercise_1.1/_____` from the unzipped [downloaded dataset](header-dataset). In alternative, open the file via
	```
	denoptim exercise_1.1/____
	```
	The graphical interface will open a window and display the graph representation contained in the file.
